## Team Member Contributions

### Glenn Ye

I worked on creating helper functions for compressing and decompressing headers using the HPACK algorithm, along with the relevant unit tests. I also contributed to integrating TLS by creating a server certificate configuration and allowing the server to detect and respond to a client TLS handshake.
